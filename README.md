# Tess-celestial

> This visual exhibit features tessellations created by Dr. Radmila Sazdanovic from the Department of Mathematics at North Carolina State University that explore the interplay of art, nature, culture, shape, perspective, and math in our everyday lives. Created using the software Tess and KnotPlot, these tessellations show symmetries of hyperbolic, negatively curved space and convey the beauty and subtlety of mathematical concepts that we encounter in our daily activities.

## About

Tess-celestial is a web-based visual application built at NCSU Libraries as part of the [Immersive Scholar project](https://www.immersivescholar.org/) and is responsively designed for exhibit across a diverse range of large-scale displays. Tess-celestial is primarily featured in the [iPearl Immersion Theater](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/visualization_templates/blob/master/HuntLibraryVideoWallGuide.md#ipearl-immersion-theater) at the James B. Hunt Jr. Library at NC State University.

This application was built using Webpack 3 and is optimized to run in the Chrome browser. The layout design has been tested on displays ranging from 27:9 to 6:5 in aspect ratio. It is not currently optimized for personal devices.
